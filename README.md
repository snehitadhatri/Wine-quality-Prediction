Wine Quality Analysis Through Data Science

Description:
Conceived and executed a data science project to predict wine quality on the basis of its chemical content. The project aimed at determining the most influential factors on taste and forecasting wine quality through machine learning algorithms.

Key Contributions & Methodology:

Dataset & Data Preprocessing:

Handled a structured dataset of wine samples with diverse chemical properties (e.g., acidity, sugar level, alcohol percentage).
Executed data cleaning, missing values handling, and normalization to make the data consistent.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Graphed relationships between wine quality ratings and chemical properties with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Located strong correlations, including how alcohol level and volatile acidity influence perceived quality.

Machine Learning Implementation:

Utilized regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for predicting wine quality as a continuous value.
Tuned model performance with feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

Technologies & Tools Utilized:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Methods: Regression analysis, feature selection, model assessment (RÂ² score, RMSE)

Results & Findings:

Found that volatile acidity and alcohol content have a strong influence on wine quality scores.
Created a predictive model that well estimates wine quality from chemical characteristics.
Illustrated the use of data science in measuring subjective qualities such as taste.


This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling and illustrates the power of data-driven methods to improve decision-making in real-world scenarios.
